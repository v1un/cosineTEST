# Development Guide

Welcome to the development guide for this project! This document is intended for contributors and team members looking to add new features or improvements. Please follow these guidelines to ensure consistent, high-quality contributions.

## 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   - Refer to the `README.md` for setup instructions specific to this project.
   - Install any required dependencies (e.g., run `pip install -r requirements.txt` for Python, or equivalent for other stacks).

3. **Set up environment variables**  
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update as necessary, if applicable.

---

## 2. Creating a New Feature or Improvement

1. **Branch from `main` or `dev`**  
   - Never commit directly to `main`.
   - Use descriptive branch names:
     ```
     git checkout -b feature/short-description
     git checkout -b improvement/short-description
     ```

2. **Write Clear, Modular Code**  
   - Follow the existing code style and conventions.
   - Use meaningful variable and function names.
   - Add comments where logic may not be immediately clear.

3. **Add Tests**  
   - All new features or improvements should include tests.
   - Place tests in the appropriate test directory, following the project's conventions.

4. **Document Your Changes**  
   - Update or add docstrings/comments in your code.
   - If the feature impacts users, update the `README.md` or relevant documentation files.

---

## 3. Running Tests

- Ensure all tests pass before submitting your changes.
- Use the project's preferred test command, e.g.:
  ```
  pytest
  npm test
  make test
  ```
- Add new test cases as needed to cover your changes.

---

## 4. Committing and Pushing

1. **Follow Conventional Commit Messages**  
   - Examples:
     - `feat: add user authentication`
     - `fix: correct typo in main page`
     - `docs: update setup instructions`
     - `test: add unit tests for Order model`
     - `refactor: simplify checkout logic`

2. **Push your branch**
   ```
   git push origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

---

## 5. Opening a Pull Request (PR)

- Open a PR against the `main` or `dev` branch, as appropriate.
- Include a clear title and description:
  - What does this PR do?
  - Why is it needed?
  - Any special instructions for reviewers?
- Link related issues (if any).

---

## 6. Code Review Process

- At least one other team member should review your PR before merging.
- Address reviewer comments promptly.
- Ensure all tests pass after changes from review.

---

## 7. Merging

- Only merge after approval and successful CI tests.
- Prefer "Squash and Merge" to keep the commit history clean.

---

## 8. Additional Guidelines

- **Performance**: Consider the performance impact of new features.
- **Security**: Follow security best practices.
- **Dependencies**: Add new dependencies only when necessary and document them.
